6.User's guide( how to use your program)
  It takes two users.
  
  First user: It's a customer who orders things.

  Running the main for client will give you a check box.
  1. Item List: Show all the products.
  2.Order : Starts the order.
  3.Update : Modify what you ordered.
  4.Your Order List: Show what you ordered. (Shopping basket)
  5.Done : End the order.

  After doing number 5, the receipt and order list will be made as txt file.

  2nd user: it's a working person when an order comes. When a customer finishes an order, a txt file is created and a list of things to do is created based on it.
  If you run main for worker, you get a check box.

  1.Show List: Show list to pack.
  2.Item Location: Check the location of the items to be imported.
  3.ClearWork: Erase the list of things you're done with.

  When the to-do list is erased, the execution is over.
