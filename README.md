<h3>6. User's guide( how to use your program)</h3><br>
  It takes two users.<br><br>
  
  First user: It's a customer who orders things.<br><br>

  Running the main for client will give you a check box.<br>
  1. Item List: Show all the products.<br>
  2.Order : Starts the order.<br>
  3.Update : Modify what you ordered.<br>
  4.Your Order List: Show what you ordered. (Shopping basket)<br>
  5.Done : End the order.<br>

  After doing number 5, the receipt and order list will be made as txt file.<br><br>

  2nd user: it's a working person when an order comes. When a customer finishes an order, a txt file is created and a list of things to do is created based on it.<br>
  If you run main for worker, you get a check box.<br><br>

  1.Show List: Show list to pack.<br>
  2.Item Location: Check the location of the items to be imported.<br>
  3.ClearWork: Erase the list of things you're done with.<br><br>

  When the to-do list is erased, the execution is over.<br><br>
